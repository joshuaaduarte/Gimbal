# **Inspiration**

<font size='4'> The idea for Gambit was born in January of 2021, at the height of the pandemic, when social distancing measures made it difficult to play physical chess with others. As a mechanical engineer, I saw this as an opportunity to not only scratch my itch for chess, but also to challenge myself by incorporating a range of mechanical, electrical, and computer science concepts into the project.

Gambit represents the convergence of my passion for chess and engineering, and my goal was to create a product that not only satisfied my personal need, but could also benefit others who find themselves in similar situations. Whether you're looking to improve your chess skills, want to enjoy a game on your own, or are simply interested in exploring the intersection of technology and chess, Gambit has something to offer. </font>

# **Timeline and Current Status** 

<font size='4'> 
In January 2021, the seeds of Gambit were planted as I embarked on a solo journey to bring my passion for chess and engineering to life. A few months later, I was presented with an opportunity to turn my idea into a reality when I received an email inviting me to submit a proposal for my senior design capstone at Texas A&M University. My proposal was accepted and, for the next year, I worked alongside four other mechanical engineers to bring Gambit to life.

By May 2022, we had successfully created a functional prototype with a massive footprint of approximately 5 inches tall, 32 inches long, and 27 inches wide. Despite the aesthetic appeal of a top plate that was half wood and half acrylic, it presented significant mechanical challenges. Despite these challenges, I was undeterred and continued to work on the project on my own, now at the University of California, Berkeley.

Armed with a makerspace and a renewed sense of determination, I set out to create the third iteration of Gambit. This version was much smaller and more compact, standing at 2.5 inches tall, 27 inches long, and 24 inches wide. I also made significant improvements to the gantry system, sensing system, and chess engine, ensuring that Gambit would be a user-friendly and enjoyable experience for players of all skill levels.

The journey to bring Gambit to life has been a long and challenging one, but I am proud of the work that I have accomplished and look forward to continuing to refine and improve upon this exciting project.
